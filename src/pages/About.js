        <p className="center">
          Hello, I'm Joyce. I'm original from Taipei city, Taiwan.


   
        
          My passion was to help people create a welcoming home.
          that can reflect their personalities and make their visions come true.
          I completed my degree in interior and architectural design in 2018 and
          soon started her professional career in an architectural firm right
          after an internship. I learned a lot from my professional work to be
          detail-oriented, a problem solver, time manager and an accountable
          person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, I found myself falling in love with technology, and I truly desire
          to be a programmer. I am taking every step to achieve my career goal
          in a huge career switch by attending an online program for IT training
          and a Full-Stack web development Boot Camp at University of New
          Hampshire.
        </p>
        <p>
          I keeps learning English, thanks to The Accelerated Career English
          (ACE) program at HCC that offered such a great opportunity for me to
          enhance my skills both professionally and personally. I just added a
          new page to my journey, and I'm hoping to share more projects and
          stories to people who is also interested in switching their career!
