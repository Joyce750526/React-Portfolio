        Hello, I'm Joyce. I'm original from Taipei city, Taiwan. Joyce Chen was
        born in Taipei city, Taiwan. In my childhood, I was inspired by one of
        my family members in the architecture industry. This brought me to study
        interior design and architecture design at Academy of Art University in
        San Francisco. I spent one year learning English in an ESL program at
        University of Tennessee.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2013, I came back to San Francisco to pursue my interior design
        degree. Along with the learning process, I truly fell in love with
        interior design. My dream was to help people create a welcoming home
        that can reflect their personalities and make their visions come true. I
        completed my degree in interior and architectural design in 2018 and
        soon started her professional career in an architectural firm right
        after an internship. I learned a lot from my professional work to be
        detail-oriented, a problem solver, time manager and an accountable
        person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, I found myself falling in love with technology, and I desired to
        be a programmer. I am taking every step to achieve my career goal in a
        huge career switch by attending an online program for IT training and a
        Full-Stack web development Boot Camp at University of New Hampshire.
      </p>

        I keeps learning English, thanks to The Accelerated Career English (ACE)
        program at HCC that offered such a great opportunity for me to enhance
        my skills both professionally and personally. I just added a new page to
        my journey, and I'm hoping to share more projects and stories to people
        who is also interested in switching their career!
